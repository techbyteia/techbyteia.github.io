<p><h2>Why i prefer both pets</h2>
I like both cats and dogs, first of all, i like dogs because they can learn tricks and they are mostly easy to take care of and they are friendly. But i also like cats because they are independent and they arent hard to take care and they are quiet, both pets are fun to play with and are both nice to just have company!
