<p><h2>Both cats and dogs are cool!</h2>
Dogs are awesome because they are so loyal. Dogs can learn a lot of tricks as well. You can even win awards to become the best dog trainer. If you want a best friend for life, get yourself a dog. But, cats are also the coolest pet. Cats are independent and don't need as much attention as dogs. Cats are quiet and don't bark and make noise like dogs do. They are much easier to take care of than a dog</p>
